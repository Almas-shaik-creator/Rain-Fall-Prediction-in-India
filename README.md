# Rain-Fall-Prediction-in-India
The Rainfall Analysis and Prediction System is a data-driven project designed to analyze historical rainfall data and provide meaningful insights to support agricultural decision-making. Agriculture in India heavily depends on monsoon rainfall, and unpredictable rainfall patterns often result in crop failure, financial losses, and poor resource planning. This project aims to address this problem by using data analytics and machine learning techniques to study rainfall trends, seasonal variations, and long-term patterns
